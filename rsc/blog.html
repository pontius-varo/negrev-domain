          <hr>
          <div>
            <b>05/23/20 | UPDATES: Updated contact, about, and blog pages.</b>
            <p>
            This is the first post of my small blog. I'm excited, as this is the first time
            I've ever done something like this. Nevertheless, there's been a couple of things on my
            mind that I'd like to get off my chest. First of all, the mounting pressure I have due to my
            new found understanding of life itself. Thanks to the mountains of information I've consumed, I have arrived
            at the point in my life where I understand what I have to do. Going forward, my focuses are primarily going to be on
            achieving excellence in three categories: Money, Muscles, and Game.
          </p>
          <p>And it seems that the first of those that I must tackle
          is Money. Why? Because as a 19 (soon to be 20) year old man I have to find a way to support myself independently, so that I can finally
          live free of the yoke of my parents. Not only that, but to finally live life on my own terms and never again have to appeal to any authority
          other than myself.</p>
          <p>
            And it's because of that desire that this website even exists! I've been learning HTML, CSS, and two programming languages (Python & Javascript)
            for the sole purpose of training myself for future employment. Employment that will hopefully provide me enough funds to go and live on my own.
            Luckly, I seem to enjoy practicing and learning these things, a caveat that makes investing time in them much more attractive than investing
            in what I was focused on previously, which was my university studies. Also, there's so much documentation online that I have paided next to nothing
            to learn, something which is practically impossible in a contemporary university, where every student (especially in the US) is racking up a debt
            of at least US$20,000 per year, excluding living expenses. And those who accumilate such debts evidently become slaves to their creditors for years,
            a fate which I would rather avoid all together.
          </p>
          <p>
            On to the second point, muscles. For one to have a good mind, one must also have a good body. The greatest minds of antiquity (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle)
            were ripped, and constantly stressed the importance of being in physical shape. In addition, women love men who are physically fit and aesthetically pleasing
            and are often more receptive of men who have those characteristics. So why not become physically fit and focus on making 'gains' ? It will not only improve
            my mental state, but also improve my results in the dating scene. To me, it is an investment which has an extremely high return in the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, there's Game, a concept which is often negatively portrayed in our contemporary era. And yet it does not deserve the constant berratement it recieves
              from our society, especially from contemporary "men". Game is simply how one interacts with the world and, most importantly, other human beings. It is the way you
              carry yourself, think about yourself, and sell yourself to others. There is nothing like it and it is often the glue which holds a person together. Everyone has game,
              whether they like it or not, and it is my goal to have good game. If I want to live the life I want to live, which will be, I assure you, radically different from
              way 99.999% of my generational counterparts wish to live, I need game.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the common theme in all these things is this: Man must become. In order to achieve my goals in these specific categories, I need to put in time and work.
              It is only after putting in the time and work neccessary that I can achieve the things I want and become the person who I want to be.
              And with each improvement, especially in those categories, I become a different person.
              No longer will I be content in 'being myself', as I wish to become better than who I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you can see, I've made the choice to change who I am to accomplish my dreams. If you've read this far, I encourage you to make a similar choice, for as Pook said:
              </p>
            <b>"It all comes down to this choice: live your dreams or live other people's dreams."</b>
                <p>
                  What will your choice be my friend?
                  </p>
